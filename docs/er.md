# Entity Resolution

Entity resolution (ER) is the process of identifying, matching, and merging records that correspond to the same entities across various databases or information systems. It plays a critical role in data quality and integration by ensuring that disparate sources of data can be unified into a single, coherent dataset. This process is essential in contexts where the same entities may be represented differently across systems due to variations in data entry, collection methods, or system architecture.

In the following scenarios, we will explore practical applications of entity resolution in a business setting, focusing on improving customer data management through merging and reconciling data from multiple sources. These examples illustrate the challenges and strategies involved in entity resolution, showcasing its importance in enhancing customer relationship management, marketing strategies, fraud detection, and overall decision-making processes.

# Scenario I: Resolving Customer Record
You work for a company that has customer data coming from multiple sources: an online store, a physical store, and a customer support system. Each source contains records about the same customers, but the records might have slight variations in how the customer's information is represented.

## Example Data
### Online Store Data:
- `John Smith, 123 Elm St, Springfield, IL, 62701`
- `J. Smith, 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Illinois, 62701`
- `Jonathan Smith, 123 Elm St, Springfield, IL, 62701`

### Physical Store Data:
- `John Smith, 123 Elm St., Springfield, IL, 62701`
- `Jon Smith, 123 Elm St, Springfield, IL, 62701`

### Customer Support System:
- `Jonathan Smith, 123 Elm St, Springfield, IL, 62701`
  - `John S., 123 Elm St, Springfield, IL, 62701`


## Steps in Entity Resolution
### Data Preprocessing:
1. Standardize address formats (e.g., `123 Elm Street` to `123 Elm St`).
2. Normalize names (e.g., expanding abbreviations like `J.` to `John`).

### Blocking/Indexing:
- Create blocks based on common attributes, such as the same zip code `62701`.

### Pairwise Comparison:
- Compare pairs of records within each block. Use similarity measures:
  - Name similarity: `John Smith` vs. `J. Smith` vs. `Jonathan Smith`
  - Address similarity: `123 Elm St` vs. `123 Elm Street`
  - City and state should match exactly.

### Classification:
- Apply rules or machine learning models to classify pairs as matches or non-matches:
  - Example:
    - `John Smith, 123 Elm St, Springfield, IL, 62701`
    - `J. Smith, 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Illinois, 62701`
    - `Classified as a match due to high similarity in name and address.`

### Clustering:
- Group matching records into clusters:
  - Cluster 1:
    - `John Smith, 123 Elm St, Springfield, IL, 62701`
    - `J. Smith, 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Illinois, 62701`
    - `Jonathan Smith, 123 Elm St, Springfield, IL, 62701`
    - `Jon Smith, 123 Elm St, Springfield, IL, 62701`
    - `John S., 123 Elm St, Springfield, IL, 62701`

### Merging:
- Consolidate information from matching records:
  - Unified Record:
    - `Name: John Smith`
    - `Address: 123 Elm St`
    - `City: Springfield`
    - `State: IL`
    - `Zip Code: 62701`

## Result
After entity resolution, the company has a single, unified customer record for John Smith that combines data from the online store, physical store, and customer support system. This unified view helps the company provide better customer service and gain more accurate insights into customer behavior.

## Applications
- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**: Maintain a single view of each customer.
- **Healthcare**: Consolidate patient records from different healthcare providers.
- **Marketing**: Ensure accurate customer segmentation and targeting.
- **Fraud Detection**: Identify duplicate records that might indicate fraudulent activity.

# Scenario II: Aggregating Customer Data

Let's expand on the unified customer record in **Scenario I** to include this historical data:

## Unified Record:
- **Name**: John Smith
- **Email**: john@example.com
- **Address**: 123 Elm St, Springfield, IL, 62701
- **Phone**: (555) 123-4567

## Additional History Data:
### Purchase History:
- **Order 1**: April 5, 2024 - Electronics - $200
- **Order 2**: May 15, 2024 - Books - $30

### Browsing History:
- April 3, 2024: Viewed Electronics section
- May 12, 2024: Viewed Books section

### Support Interactions:
- April 6, 2024: Inquiry about product return policy
- May 16, 2024: Issue with order delivery

### Marketing Interactions:
- April 10, 2024: Opened email campaign on new electronics
- May 17, 2024: Clicked on promotional offer for books

### Behavioral Data:
- Frequently browses electronics and books categories
- Tends to make purchases during weekend sales

### How the Merged History Data Can be Used

1. **Personalized Marketing:**
   - **Targeted Campaigns:** Use purchase and browsing history to send personalized email campaigns that highlight products in categories the customer has shown interest in.
   - **Tailored Promotions:** Offer discounts or promotions on items that the customer has previously viewed but not purchased.
2. **Customer Service Efficiency:**
   - **Comprehensive Support:** When the customer contacts support, representatives have access to the entire history, enabling them to provide better and faster assistance.
   - **Issue Resolution:** Previous support interactions help in quickly identifying recurring issues and providing appropriate solutions.
3. **Sales Opportunities:**
   - **Cross-Selling:** Use purchase history to recommend complementary products. For instance, if the customer bought a laptop, suggest accessories like a laptop bag or external mouse.
   - **Upselling:** Encourage the customer to buy higher-end versions of products they have shown interest in or purchased before.
4. **Improved Analytics:**
   - **Customer Insights:** Analyze behavioral and purchase patterns to understand customer preferences and trends, aiding in product stocking and strategic planning.
   - **Segmentation:** Group customers with similar histories for targeted marketing and loyalty programs.
5. **Fraud Detection:**
   - **Anomaly Detection:** Use historical data to spot unusual activity patterns that may indicate fraud. For example, a sudden spike in high-value purchases could be flagged for further investigation.

# Scenario III: Unifying Customer Data

Letâ€™s go through a practical example with customer purchase history data from three sources:

### Source Data:
#### Online Store:
- **Record 1**: `{"customer_id": "123", "purchase_date": "2024-04-05", "category": "Electronics", "amount": 200}`
- **Record 2**: `{"customer_id": "123", "purchase_date": "2024-05-15", "category": "Books", "amount": 30}`

#### Physical Store:
- **Record 3**: `{"customer_id": "123", "order_date": "2024-04-05", "item_category": "Electronics", "price": 200}`
- **Record 4**: `{"customer_id": "123", "order_date": "2024-06-10", "item_category": "Home & Kitchen", "price": 50}`

#### Customer Support:
- **Record 5**: `{"customer_id": "123", "issue_date": "2024-04-06", "issue": "Product return inquiry"}`
- **Record 6**: `{"customer_id": "123", "issue_date": "2024-05-16", "issue": "Order delivery problem"}`

### Unified Record:
#### Step-by-Step Merging Process:
##### Data Standardization:
- Normalize dates and attribute names:
  - `order_date` -> `transaction_date`
  - `item_category` -> `category`
  - `price` -> `amount`

##### Data Matching:
- Match records using `customer_id`.

##### Consolidation Rules:
- Combine purchase records, prefer latest entries for conflicts, and aggregate support interactions.

##### Data Merging:
###### Purchase History:
- `{"transaction_date": "2024-04-05", "category": "Electronics", "amount": 200}`
- `{"transaction_date": "2024-05-15", "category": "Books", "amount": 30}`
- `{"transaction_date": "2024-06-10", "category": "Home & Kitchen", "amount": 50}`

###### Support Interactions:
- `{"issue_date": "2024-04-06", "issue": "Product return inquiry"}`
- `{"issue_date": "2024-05-16", "issue": "Order delivery problem"}`

#### Final Unified Record:
```json
{
  "customer_id": "123",
  "name": "John Smith",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "address": "123 Elm St, Springfield, IL, 62701",

}
```
