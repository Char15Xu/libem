# Libem Design
----------------

Inspired by the [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy), libem is designed to:
- Separate modules from parameters (prompts, configs, tools, and weights).
- Optimize the parameters with hyperparameter tuning.

## Integration

Libem can be used as a CLI tool, over a chat interface (like a chatbot), a web service endpoint, or an embedded library.
